In either case, the estimate is made to the nearest okta (eighth) and is reported on a scale which is essentially one of the nearest eighth, except that figures 0 and 8 on the scale signify a completely clear and cloudy sky, respectively, with consequent adjustment to the adjacent 1 and 7 okta intervals." ;
