      <h2>Biological sex</h2>
      <p class="description">The biological sex observable variable refers to a classification based on physical and genetic characteristics typically used to distinguish individuals as female, male, intersex, or unknown. These categories are based on biological factors such as chromosomes, hormones, and reproductive anatomy. The term intersex includes individuals whose biological characteristics do not fit typical definitions of male or female, while unknown indicates cases where the biological sex cannot be determined or has not been specified.</p>
