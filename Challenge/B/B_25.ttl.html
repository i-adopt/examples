      <h2>Dynamic viscosity of polystyrene</h2>
      <p class="description">Measure of the material&#39;s resistance to flow when subjected to a shear force. In dynamic conditions, this viscosity is determined by applying oscillating shear forces to the polystyrene sample, and the material&#39;s response is measured. Testing dynamic shear viscosity at specific temperatures helps manufacturers determine how the material will perform under different conditions like injection molding or extrusion.</p>
