      <h2>atmosphere optical thickness due to particulate organic matter ambient aerosol particles</h2>
      <p class="description">Optical thickness measures how much radiation is scattered or absorbed as it travels through a medium. It reduces the radiative flux by a factor of exp(-optical_thickness) along the path. Atmospheric optical thickness refers to radiation passing through the entire atmosphere and can be measured at specific wavelengths or frequencies. Aerosols are particles suspended in the air (excluding cloud droplets), while ambient aerosols refer to particles in their natural environment, influenced by local pressure, temperature, and humidity. The extent of water absorption by these particles depends on humidity and their composition.</p>
